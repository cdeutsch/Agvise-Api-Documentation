### 3 Step Export Process

Since running calculations on many Samples at one time can take longer then a typical web request, we've broken the process into 3 steps (2 if you implement [Webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook))

1. [Create an Export](#export-create)
2. [Check the Export Status](#export-status) (Optional with Webhooks)
2. [Download the Export](#export-download)
